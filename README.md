# LUT: Live User Touch

Welcome to LUT, an interactive video art installation that explores the relationship between human interaction and digital media. Inspired by Look-Up Tables (LUTs) used in professional color grading, this project transforms ordinary videos into dynamic, responsive artworks that change based on your movements. Just as a colorist uses LUTs to create specific moods and atmospheres in films, you can now create your own color grading effects in real-time through touch and movement.

## What Is This?

LUT is an interactive video installation that responds to your presence. Think of it as a digital canvas where:
- Videos become living, breathing entities that react to your movements
- Your mouse or touch becomes a paintbrush that alters the emotional tone of the visuals
- The experience is unique to each viewer's interaction
- You become the colorist, creating your own look-up tables through movement

## How to Use It

1. **Start the Experience**
   - Open the webpage in your browser
   - Wait for the video to load
   - You'll see a video playing in the center of the screen

2. **Interact with the Art**
   - Move your mouse or finger left and right:
     - Moving left makes the colors cooler (more blue) - like applying a cool LUT
     - Moving right makes the colors warmer (more orange) - like applying a warm LUT
   - Move up and down:
     - Moving up increases contrast (makes brights brighter, darks darker) - like increasing contrast in color grading
     - Moving down reduces contrast (makes everything more even) - like flattening the image
   - Use left/right arrow keys to switch between different videos

3. **Experiment and Play**
   - Try different combinations of movements
   - Notice how your interactions change the mood of the video
   - Each video responds differently to your touch
   - Create your own unique color grading style

## The Artistic Concept

This project explores several key ideas in digital art and media:

### 1. Interactive Art
- Traditional art is static; digital art can be dynamic
- The viewer becomes a participant in creating the artwork
- Each interaction creates a unique experience
- You become both the colorist and the audience

### 2. Color and Emotion
- Colors have psychological effects on viewers
- Warm colors (orange/red) often evoke feelings of energy and passion
- Cool colors (blue) often create feelings of calm and contemplation
- By controlling color temperature, you're essentially "painting" with emotions
- Each movement creates a new color grading look-up table

### 3. Contrast and Drama
- Contrast in art creates visual hierarchy
- High contrast draws attention to specific elements
- Low contrast creates a more unified, peaceful feeling
- Your vertical movements control this dramatic tension
- Like adjusting contrast in professional color grading

### 4. Digital Transformation
- This project shows how digital technology can transform ordinary media
- Videos become interactive canvases
- Human movement becomes a creative tool
- The line between viewer and creator becomes blurred
- Real-time color grading becomes an interactive experience

## Technical Background (For the Curious)

This project uses WebGL, a technology that allows web browsers to create complex graphics. Think of it as a digital paintbrush that can:
- Process video in real-time
- Apply color effects instantly (like a real-time LUT)
- Respond to user input immediately
- Create dynamic look-up tables based on movement

The technology works like this:
1. The video plays like normal
2. Your movements are tracked
3. The computer applies color and contrast effects based on your position (similar to how a colorist applies LUTs)
4. The result is displayed instantly
5. Each movement creates a new color grading preset

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Environment**
   - Use a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)
   - Ensure your screen brightness is at a comfortable level
   - Consider using headphones for the full experience

2. **Interaction**
   - Start with gentle movements
   - Notice how different videos respond differently
   - Try to create different moods through your movements
   - Experiment with different color grading styles

3. **Exploration**
   - Don't be afraid to experiment
   - Each video offers different possibilities
   - Your unique interaction creates your personal artwork
   - Create your own signature color grading look

## About the Project

LUT was created to explore the intersection of technology and art, demonstrating how digital tools can create new forms of interactive expression. Inspired by Look-Up Tables used in professional color grading, this project brings the power of real-time color manipulation into an interactive experience. It's particularly relevant for:
- Digital art enthusiasts
- Media studies students
- Anyone interested in interactive experiences
- People curious about the future of digital media
- Aspiring colorists and filmmakers
